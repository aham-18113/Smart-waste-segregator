# Smart-waste-segregator

# Object

Hardware realization of classifying dry and wet waste and segregating it into respective bins.

# Project description

A smart dry and wet waste segregator is a project that can automatically sort different types of waste using sensors and an Arduino UNO microcontroller. It works by detecting the moisture level of the waste and sending a signal to the servo motor that moves a flap to direct the waste into the appropriate bin.
